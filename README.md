Nashville has seen an explosion of growth over the past decade and a half. With that growth comes the nearly inevitable increase in crime that, sadly, all cities struggle with as more and more people cluster closer together. With this project, I wanted to see which areas of the city are most impacted by crime; how it's coloring their perceptions of crime prevention and police efforts; see if there's a correlation that we can detect between those areas and other areas of city services; and offer any recommendations I can find to improve conditions.

### **Motivation**   
I've been a Metro Nashvillle Government employee - serving as Public Information Officer at Nashville Public Library - for nearly five years now. Nearly every day, I walk to work at the Main Library in Downtown Nashville and watch the city change. I interact with people from all walks of life who come into our library seeking enrichment, community, entertainment, and in some cases, relief from their everyday lives. Some of those people live in the areas highly impacted by crime that I identify in this project. Helping people like them inspires much of what I do in my professional life.

Crime - and it's impact on a city - has always been an area of interest to me. Next to the economy, it seems like whenever dissatisfaction with a city, neighborhood, or government comes up, crime is involved. Since tracking, cataloguing, and archiving criminal activity involves huge amounts of data, I felt like this project would give me the chance to exercise the skills I've learned in this course, challenge myself with a relatively amount of data, and bring those two aspects together through a topic that interesets me.

Finally, I got into this field because I've seen the power of data-driven decision-making to improve efficiency, avoid wasted time, and simply make people's jobs easier. I saw it during my eight years of service in the U.S. Army, and I've seen it through nearly seven years of professional marketing roles. I love everything about exploring data, and I wanted to be a part of it.

### **Data Questions**  
- What areas of Nashville are most impacted by crime? 
- Are the residents in those areas more dissatisfied with crime and police than other areas?
- Does living in a high-crime areas skew residentsâ€™ perceptions of other city services, as well?
- Can anything be done to improve conditions?

### **Data Sources and Tools**   
**Data Sources**   
The Metro Nashville Government maintains [an open record portal](https://data.nashville.gov) with access to a wide array of tables and databases that record various aspects of Metro activities in Nashville. 

I used three of these datasets to complete this project:
- [Metro Nashville Police Deparment Incidents](https://data.nashville.gov/Police/Metro-Nashville-Police-Department-Incidents/2u6v-ujjs 'incident in Nashville'): this table contains information about various incidents that Metro Police have responded to, the date/time it occured, what type of incident it was, where it occured, how many vicitms, etc.
- [hubNashville (311) Service Requests](https://data.nashville.gov/Public-Services/hubNashville-311-Service-Requests/7qhx-rexh 'requests for service from Metro Nashville'): this dataset contains requests from city residents for a wide array of services from the city, including garbage removal, streets and sidewalks improvement, permit requests, and more.
- [Metro Resident Survey Responses (2018)](https://data.nashville.gov/General-Government/Metro-Resident-Survey-Responses/nux7-cwab 'responses from 2018 survey'): This dataset contains ratings by residents of Metro Nashville about various facets of life in the city, including Quality of Life, Crime Prevention, Schools, Trash Services, Elected Officials, and much more. The survey results are catalogued by ZIP code, with responses either in a "Very Dissatisfied, Dissatisfied, Neutral, Satisfied, Very Satisfied, Don't Know" or "Yes or Now" categories.

**Data Security and Safety**
All three datasets I used for this project are considered open data and readily accessible to anyone through Nashville's data portal. There is no PDI that could inextricably expose the identities of anyone in this data (no names, social security numbers, dates of birth, personal addresses, phone numbers, etc.)

**Tools**
- `Python`, version 3.10.9   
- `Jupyter Notebook`, version 6.5.2   
- `Power BI`, version 2.122.746.0 64-bit (October 2023)
- `MS Excel`, Microsoft 365

### **Known Issues and Challenges** 
  
**Issues with Survey Responses** 
While much of this project hinges on tying everything together with the Metro Resident Survey responses, there are extensive limitations in the Survey dataset which forces this project to serve as a proof-of-concept, instead of a tool for decision-making, including:

- The Survey concluded in 2018, and a new one has not been initiated, meaning these responses (and the views represented) are now five years old and most likely do not accurately reflect residents' views today. 
- Before filtering, there were only 2,171 responses to the Survey; the population of Nashville was roughly 650,000 in 2018, meaning the Survey's respondents represented less than 1% of the population at the time.
- The responses are heavily skewed to about 15 of the 25 original ZIP codes represented; in some cases, there were as few as 1 response per ZIP code; I chose to remove any ZIPs that did not have at least 10 responses to avoid skewing results without at least something reminiscient of a variety of perspectives.

**Considerations in MNPD Incidents**
- MNPD is noted for frequest collaborations with the police departments of neighboring counties and cities; within this report, there were instances of an incident that actually concluded in a ZIP that was outside of Davidson County; I removed these as I wanted incidents which were contained within Davidson County.
- Within the original data, I found instances where an incident was closed because it was either an unfounded report, the victim was uncooperative, or the victim refused to prosecute. While this is viable data for further analysis, it was not the focus of my project as I wanted only incidents where the police/criminal justice system could take futher action, so I removed these incidents from the data.

**hubNashville ZIP Codes Mismatch**  
- Much like MNPD Incidents, the hubNashville dataset contained ZIP Codes that feel outside of Davidson County, were formatted differently (float vs. int vs. string), and in one case simply read 'TN'. I changed all floats to intergers, removed any ZIPs outside of Davidson County and did not specify a ZIP code.


**Narrowing Focus to Give Accurate Results**
Given the relatively restricted timeline for this project, I had to be very concious about which field(s) would be support generating the answers I wanted to give for this project. For example: within the Survey, there were fields for 'Police Overall', 'Police Response Time', 'Police Professionalism', etc. All these fields could contain valueble insights, but when measured against the time I had available - and the outcome I wanted to achieve - I chose to measure against the 'Police Overall' field only.

### **Approach Outline:**  
- **ETL** to extract the data from data.nashville.gov; examine it to determine what transformation may be needed (if any), and then load it into SQL/Python
- Determine which categories (columns/fields) in the Resident Survey best tie to the MNPD Incidents and hubNashville Requests datasets. 
- Determine what the **MVP** (minimum viable product) looks like for charts and for the intaractive dashboard
- **EDA** (exploratory data analysis). Outline of primary steps (not a comprehensive list of *all* steps)  
    - Examine data types (esp. dates and geography/location/lat&lng)  
    - Look for nulls
    - Ensure ZIP Codes fall within Davidson County  
    - Understand what unique values are in each column and seeing which ones are most prevelant and most relevant to              
      answering the data questions
    - Examine statistics for each series with numerical values  
- Determine the best methods for either merging and/or subsetting the data to facilitate creating the charts and creating the dashboard, and explore the answers to the data questions
- Validate that the charts are showing information correctly, with no *irrelevant* data included, and no *relevant* data inadvertently excluded
- Create charts and graphs
- Prepare presentation and record demo 
- Create dashboard

### **Acknowledgements**
When I started this course, I wasn't sure what to expect. What's more, I was nowhere near convinced that I had the capacity to transition into data analytics. Now, six months later, much of those doubts are void, and it's because of the unwavering support from the instructors, staff, and fellow students at  **Nashville Software School.** 
- I cannot begin to express the depths of gratitude I feel toward our instructors - **Dibran Rexhepi,** **Olariche "Ola" Obe,** **Alex Wright,** and **Sobiya Uddin.** These four folks absolutely floored me with their patience, their knoweldge, their willingness to do whatever was required to help a student, and their devotion to making sure not only that we pass this course, but that we truly understand what we can and must do to succeed as data analysts.
- I am indebted to **Ashley Canino,** and **Michael Frieh** of NSS's Career Development Team for their tirless work to provide career development tools, Q&As with working data analysts, resume building and review sessions, mock interview opprotunities, and the countless hours spent coordinating Demo Day and other opportunities for students. 
- **Zoe Teets,** a graduate of NSS who came back not once, but three times to coach us on Power BI, Tableau, and other topics, and who provided the most candid, inside-look at the life of a data visualization specialist I've seen thus far!
- **My classmates in DA Cohort #09**: They say that shared suffering is what truly builds a team. I don't know if you could truly call the last six months "suffering", but they were - without a shred of doubt - filled with fear, frustration, and doubt along the way. Fortunately, this class rallied together like few groups I've ever been a part of. Whether it was taking the time to demonstrate a successful way to resolve a problem, or just offering words of encouragement in times of stress, my classmates in DA9 had my back the whole time, and all I can say is that I'll never truly be able to repay their kindess, and can only hope that I was able to give them what they needed to thrive, as well.
